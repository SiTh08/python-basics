# Numerical Data types
# - Int, long, float, complex
# These are numerical data types, which we can use numerical operators.

# Complex and Long we don't use as much
# Complex brings an imaginary type of number
# Long - are integers of unlimited size. Prime number


# int - Stands for integers
# Whole numbers

my_int = 10
print(my_int)
print(type(my_int))

# Operators - Add, Subtract, divide and multiply
    # Exponential

print(4 + 3)
print(4 - 3)
print(4/2) # Divisions automatically get converted to float
print(125//3) # Keeps it as a integer / drops the decimal
print (5/2)
print (5//2)
print(4 * 3)
print(3**2)

# Modulus looks for the remainders number
# %

print(11%3) ## --> 3*3 = 9, so 2 is the remainder
print(14%5) ## --> 2*5 = 10, so 4 is the remainder

# Floats = decimals

# Comparison operators # --> (output) boolean value (true or false)

# == - comparison operator
# < / > - smaller and bigger than
# <= - smaller than or equal
# >= - bigger than or equal
# != - not equal
# is and is not - equals or not equals

my_variable1 = 10
my_variable2 = 13
print(my_variable1 == my_variable2)
print(my_variable1 > my_variable2)
print(my_variable1 < my_variable2)
print(my_variable2 >= 13)
print(my_variable2 is 13)
print(my_variable2 is not 13)
